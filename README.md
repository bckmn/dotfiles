# dotfiles

This repo contains my dotfile configuration, allowing for a consistent computing experience across multiple machines.

I manage the various configuration files in this repo using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).  This allows me to set up symlinks for all of my dotfiles using a single command:

```sh
stow .
```

# Inspiration

The inspiration for this configuration comes from the [dotfiles by elliotminns](https://github.com/elliottminns/dotfiles). If you're looking for inspiration to create your own configuration, or improve your system configuration synchronisation, then I'd suggest watching his videos.
